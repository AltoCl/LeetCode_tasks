# Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.
#
# Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.
#
# You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.
#
# Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.
