# A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
# #
# # For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
# # Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.
# #
# # A sentence is circular if:
# #
# # The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
# # The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
# # For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.
# #
# # Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.
