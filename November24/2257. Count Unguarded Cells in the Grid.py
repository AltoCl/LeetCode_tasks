# You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.
#
# A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
#
# Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

        grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)] # Initialize grid with zeros
        # Mark obstacles
        for x, y in guards + walls: # gx,gy - Guards/Walls position
            grid[x][y] = 2
        # Process guards' vision
        directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
        for gx, gy in guards:
            for dx, dy in directions: # dx, dy - movement direction offsets
                x, y = gx, gy
                # Check cells in current direction until hitting boundary or obstacle
                while 0 <= x + dx < m and 0 <= y + dy < n and grid[x + dx][y + dy] != 2:
                    x += dx
                    y += dy
                    grid[x][y] = 1
        return sum(row.count(0) for row in grid) # Count unguarded cells (value 0)
