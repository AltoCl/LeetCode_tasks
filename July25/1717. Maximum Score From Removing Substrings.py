# You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.
#
# Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
# For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
# Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
# For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
# Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.
