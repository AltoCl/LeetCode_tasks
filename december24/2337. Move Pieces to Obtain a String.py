# You are given two strings start and target, both of length n. Each string consists only of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' where:
#
# The characters 'L' and 'R' represent pieces, where a piece 'L' can move to the left only if there is a blank space directly to its left, and a piece 'R' can move to the right only if there is a blank space directly to its right.
# The character '_' represents a blank space that can be occupied by any of the 'L' or 'R' pieces.
# Return true if it is possible to obtain the string target by moving the pieces of the string start any number of times. Otherwise, return false.
