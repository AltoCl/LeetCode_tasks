# You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
#
# You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:
#
# From a cell (row, col), you can move to any of the cells: (row - 1, col + 1), (row, col + 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) such that the value of the cell you move to, should be strictly bigger than the value of the current cell.
# Return the maximum number of moves that you can perform.
