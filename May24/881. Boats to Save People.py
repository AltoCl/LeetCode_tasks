# You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person,
# and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit.
# Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        left, right = 0, len(people) - 1
        boats = 0

        while left <= right:
            if people[left] + people[right] <= limit:
                left += 1
            right -= 1
            boats += 1

        return boats
